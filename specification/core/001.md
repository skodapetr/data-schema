# There is a property.

## Requirement
We can express existence of a property with no additional information given.
Especially there is no need to connect a property and an entity.
Reason is that we can be able to detect existence of a property with no connection to an entity.
Examples of properties are:
- Class property
- Key in a JSON object
- RDF property

Property is a _technical resource_.

## Notes

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/name> a dsc:Property .
```

## RDF
```Turtle
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

dsc:TechnicalResource a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Technical resource"@en .

dsc:Property a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf dsc:TechnicalResource ;
  rdfs:label "Property"@en .
```
