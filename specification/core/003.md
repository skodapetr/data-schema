# An entity can have properties.

## Requirement
Entity can have none, one or more properties.
No ordering or additional information may be defined.

## Notes
There are multiple approaches how to express connection:
* An Entity has a Property
* A Property belongs to Entity
* There is a connection object connecting Entity and Property

Since developers are used to write classes with properties, we employ the first approach.
Yet it may be usefull to add additional metadata to the property.
We address this using other means (_QualifiedRelation_).

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/Person> a dsc:Entity ;
  dsc:property <http://example.com/resources/name> .

<http://example.com/resources/name> a dsc:Property .
```

## RDF
```Turtle
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

dsc:property a rdfs:Predicate ;
  rdfs:label "Has property"@en ;
  rdfs:range dsc:Entity ;
  rdfs:domain dsc:Property .
```
