# A property can have a type.

## Requirement
Property can have at most a single type. 

## Notes
In languages like TypeScript or JSON Schema property can have multiple types.
It can be an intersection, anyOf, etc..
We address all above by introducing additional type.
Thus we are shifting the complexity to working with types.

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/name> a dsc:Property ;
  dsc:type <http://example.com/resources/string> .

<http://example.com/resources/string> a dsc:Type .
```

## RDF
```Turtle
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

dsc:type a rdfs:Predicate ;
  rdfs:label "Has type"@en ;
  rdfs:range dsc:Property ;
  rdfs:domain dsc:Type .
```
