# A technical resource can have a technical name.

## Requirement
Technical resources can have a single technical name.

## Notes
For example in frontend, backend and database.
As a result, it may seems logical to allow for multiple technical names.
This can be handy when entities from different sources are merged together.
Yet by doing so we would loose ability to distinguish between the sources.
Instead we allow for only a one and introduce aggregation later.

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/name> a dsc:Property ;
  dsfsc:name "name" .
```

## RDF
```Turtle
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

dsfsc:name a rdfs:Predicate ;
  rdfs:label "Technical name"@en ;
  rdfs:range dsc:TechnicalResource ;
  rdfs:domain rdfs:Literal .
```
