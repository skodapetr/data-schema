# There is a primitive type.

## Requirement
There is a way for a user to introduce their custom primitive type.

## Notes
Instead of restricting users to predefined set of primitive types, we allow users to define their own.
As a result users can introduce types for a language or a format of choice.

We should also introduce primitive types for common languages and formats such as:
- JavaScript
- JSON
- XML
- Python

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/string> a dsc:Type, dst:PrimitiveType .
```

## RDF
```Turtle
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

dst:PrimitiveType a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Primitive type"@en ;
  rdfs:subClassOf dsc:Type.
```
