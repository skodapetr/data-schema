# Workspace contains resources.

## Requirement
Resource can belong to just one workspace.

## Notes
Should we include all resources transitively, or do we need to enumerate all resources?

## Solution
```Turtle
<http://example.com/resources/workspace> a dsw:Workspace ;
  dsw:part <http://example.com/resources/Person> .

<http://example.com/resources/Person> a dsc:Entity .
```
